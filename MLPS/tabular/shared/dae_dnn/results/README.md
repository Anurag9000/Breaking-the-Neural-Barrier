# Results Layout

The canonical result layout for current and future tabular DAE/DNN runs is:

- `MLPS/tabular/shared/dae_dnn/results/stl/ablation/<suite_name>/`
- `MLPS/tabular/shared/dae_dnn/results/adp/w2d/<suite_name>/`
- `MLPS/tabular/shared/dae_dnn/results/archive/<legacy_suite>/`

Use the active suite roots for resumable runs. Put old runs under `archive/`
instead of adding more sibling result trees at the top level.

Current recommended fresh roots:

- STL: `MLPS/tabular/shared/dae_dnn/results/stl/ablation/parammatched_decade_v1`
- ADP: `MLPS/tabular/shared/dae_dnn/results/adp/w2d/repeat5_v1`

The planned STL schedule lives at:

- `MLPS/tabular/shared/dae_dnn/results/stl/ablation/parammatched_decade_v1/planned_params_by_task_depth_width.csv`

Archived outputs already moved there include:

- `MLPS/tabular/shared/dae_dnn/results/archive/stl_ablation_parameter_matched_gpu_serial`
